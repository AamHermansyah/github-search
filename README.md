## [Github Search Users By Aam Hermansyah](https://github-search-eight-beryl.vercel.app/)

Is a web application that utilizes **React**, **Vite JS**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Typescript** technologies to access the GitHub REST API. This application allows users to search for GitHub users and display the results in a list.

In this application, users can enter a search keyword in the search box and then send a request to the **GitHub API** using the **REST** technology. After receiving a response from the API, the data will be displayed in the form of a list of users that match the search criteria.

The user interface of this application is designed using the Tailwind CSS framework, making it look modern and responsive across various screen sizes. Additionally, this application also utilizes Typescript as the programming language, resulting in more structured and easily understandable code.

In terms of performance, this application is built using Vite JS, a very fast bundler, allowing the application to run quickly and responsively. In terms of development, you can use this code as a reference to create a similar application, following the same principles and adapting it to your needs.
